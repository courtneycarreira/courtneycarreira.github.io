## About Me

I am a first-year graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am an observational astronomer, with a particular interest in star formation and its associated processes. Currently, I'm working with Professor Brant Robertson in the [UCSC Computational Astrophysics](https://robertson.sites.ucsc.edu/) group, using data from the [JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)](https://jades-survey.github.io/) to study star formation extragalactically.

I'm also working with Eric Koch and Sarah Jeffreson at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian on a project studying the effect of spiral structure on molecular cloud and star formation.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Physics, with a minor in Applied Mathematics & Statistics, from Johns Hopkins University in May 2023.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking - along the way, I'm digitizing all of my family's old recipes from Cuba!
